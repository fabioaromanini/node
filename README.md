## Section 2:

V8 is an opensource Javascript Engine (turns Javascript code into machine language), built to power Google Chrome.
It's written in C++, and is easily integrated into other C++ programs.
Follows ECMASCRIPT standard.

## Section 3:

Nodejs is an opensorce Javascript Runtime (executes javascript code), built upon V8. As V8, Nodejs is also written in C++, but it also haves js code. It's aimed to suport servers, so it adds functionalities to Javascript, like:
- Deals with files
- Connects with database
- Communicate over the internet
- Accepts requests and send responses.
